In a little box world, there lives you -  a little red monster - a cube that kills everything it touches. But now, to survive, win and rack up that high score, you have to save everyone from yourself.

CONTROLS:
Arrow keys for movement (allows 8-dimensional motion)

Spacebar to brake

RULES (IMPORTANT):
1) The player accelerates constantly

2) The player can brake and stay in the same place for 3 seconds by pressing the spacebar. You can brake every 15 seconds, but if you don't move after 3 seconds of braking, you'll start moving in a random direction.

3) The player can collect cards as modifiers - blue cards slow the player down, red cards speed the player up.

4) If the player touches the white boundary, a blue creature will spawn. The player must not kill any blue creatures for as long as possible to get the highest possible score.  Blue creatures die upon touching the player.

5) The score is simply the number of seconds a player plays before killing a blue creature.

6) If you lose, the game auto restarts in 5 seconds.
